It is one of the best gems of the area with amazing food and lovely service. It's too bad the place doesn't get many visitors. They feature Pho, Hu Tieu and Mi, rice plates, egg noodles, Rice Vermicelli, Banh Mi, and other Vietnamese classics. Saigon Bistro gives amazing food for a low price.", :user_id => 1, :store_id => 1)
